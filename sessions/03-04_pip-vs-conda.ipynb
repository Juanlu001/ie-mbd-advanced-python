    "1. **Downloading it from Python.org**, the most common option, works in all operative systems, does not require admin permissions, allows you to choose the version you want, and ships a tool to create development environments (`venv`). However, `venv` cannot create environments with different Python versions (you're tied to the one you downloaded) and certain packages will require extra steps to be installed. Therefore, it is _not for everyone_.\n",
    "2. ~Using the OS-provided Python~, the second most common one, applies to Linux and macOS, and it is **the wrong thing to do**. It requires admin privileges, and manipulating the installation might leave the system in a broken state.\n",
    "3. **Using Anaconda** has all the advantages of Python.org, and additionally makes it trivial to install common Scientific/Data libraries on Windows using `conda`. However, mixing `conda` with the official Python package installer, `pip`, might produce unexpected results, and requires careful handling. This will be our choice.\n",

Packages are installed with `pip`. Useful to know because it's the most common option, but does not work with `conda`, so we won't use it in this course.\n",
